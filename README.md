# Parent-Teacher Communication App (React)

This repository is a high-level overview of my work on a React-based web app for a collaborative class project. The project's source code is private.

## Project Goal
To build a web platform that streamlines parent-teacher interaction, keeping families better informed and involved in students' progress.

## My Contributions
As a frontend developer on the team, I was responsible for UI/UX design and core component implementation.

* Created the core UI in **Figma** and implemented the **Home page, Sidebar, Messaging page, and Chat page** as reusable **React components**.
* Built the front-end workflow, including **dynamic routes, page transitions, and state-driven view updates** using **React Router** and custom CSS.

### Tech Stack I Used:
* **React**
* **React Router**
* **Figma** (for UI/UX Design)
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **CSS3**
